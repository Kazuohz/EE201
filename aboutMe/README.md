**Hey Everyone!**
My name is *Ethan Takahashi*, an Electrical & Computer Engineer at the University of Washington!

## Engineering Journey
- I was admitted to the University of Washington as an ENGRUD freshman back in Fall 2021
- During the first year of college, I finished my general education requirements, eventually applying to and getting accepted into the Electrical & Computer Engineering major, which I declared at the end of the year.
- Also during the first year, I attempted to join various engineering RSOs, but was rejected from all that I attempted, thus I decided to teach myself to code in C++ over the summer, along with getting better at coding in Java.
- At the beginning of the next school year, I learned how to program in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL, along with joining the Sensor Systems Lab research lab.
- I became a regular at the lab through the rest of the year, gaining skills in using hardware such as a VNA, Oscilloscope, Waveform generator, and arduinos.
- I officially became an intern at the lab once the school year ended, working more intensely over the summer.
